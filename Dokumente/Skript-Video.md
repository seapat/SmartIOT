Corona has shifted our priorities in life. A lot of time is spent at home, be it for leisure or work reasons and so new problems arose or we finally became aware of those who already existed. Bad air at home, mould, headaches, poor sleep and suddenly you had to take care of your working conditions.

So far these problems have been solved by ventilating on luck, which can lead to increased heating costs and damage to the environment, or we have simply accepted it and done nothing. 

We want to solve those problems through air measurements with a compact user-friendly device. You can measure many aspects like Temperature, Co2 and many more in your air and we help you to evaluate your values for better and optimal living conditions. 

Our device is unique because you can make the desired settings in our app. Be it to know whether you have optimal conditions to prevent mould in a room or in your food, the perfect working conditions or conditions for sleeping. Our app will tell you what to do. But not only is it user-friendly, it is also easily accessed via wifi. This makes it very easy to monitor your home and so you can improve your health and have the best home you can get.

We are Team 17. We consist of five students from the university of tübingen. Leandro Risoli,Leon Pfletschinger, David Layer-Reiss, Sean Klein and Luca Dürkop. We are Quinternity.

Corona has shifted priorities in our day-to-day lives. Much more time is now spent at home, be it for leisure or work reasons and so, new problems, as well as pre-existing problems, became apparent which need to be dealt with. Bad air at home causes mold,  headaches, and poor sleep. Suddenly, you have to take care of your working conditions yourself.

So far, we have not addressed these issues. Changing that is difficult, as this requires a lot of expertise and effort.
